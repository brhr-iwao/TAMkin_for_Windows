# TAMkin for Windows
[TAMkin](http://molmod.ugent.be/software/tamkin)
is a post-processing toolkit for nomal mode analysis, thermochemistry and reaction kinetics.

##### Description
[TAMkin](http://molmod.ugent.be/software/tamkin) is a post-processing toolkit for nomal mode analysis, thermochemistry and reaction kinetics, developed by [the group](http://molmod.ugent.be/) of An Ghysels, Toon Verstraelen and Veronique Van Speybroeck at  [Ghent University](http://www.ugent.be/en).
It uses a Hessian computation from a standard computational chemistry program as its input. CHARMM, CP2K, CPMD, GAMESS, QCHEM and VASP are supported.
Multiple methods are implemented to perform a normal mode analysis (NMA).
The frequencies from the NMA can be used to construct a molecular partition function to derive thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.

##### How to use
Please see [the Release](https://github.com/brhr-iwao/TAMkin\_for\_Windows/releases) for installation and usage of TAMkin-1.0.6. For TAMkin-1.2.4, please see [an instruction for installing TAMkin 1.2.4 on your Windows PC](https://github.com/brhr-iwao/TAMkin_for_Windows/blob/master/An_instruction_for_installing_tamkin124_on_your_windows_PC.md).
